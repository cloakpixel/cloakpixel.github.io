We develop a framework for user-centered design of adversarial tools and draw lessons on risk disclosure from U.S. product liability, consumer protection, and negligence law. Combining these, we develop a set of concrete recommendations to help FDRM adversarial tool makers decrease user harm through better communication around risk.\n","permalink":"https://github.com/cloakpixel/cloakpixel.github.io/blog/post-1/","tags":["communication"],"title":"The Broken Shield - ICLR 2021"},{"categories":["tour"],"contents":"Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.

The tool also embeds a visible watermark and encodes a steganographic message that both communicate a lack of consent to face recognition processing.\nThe open-source repository provides documentation and instructions for training and using face detection adversarial attack.\n","permalink":"https://github.com/cloakpixel/cloakpixel.github.io/blog/post-2/","tags":["tools"],"title":"equalAIs"}]
