In 2021 a team of engineers and researchers concerned about the ethical ramifications of face detection and recognition model (FDRM) technologies came together to build on the momumentum of an earlier project, [equalAIs](https://equalais.media.mit.edu/). The Cloak & Pixel team sought to:

- Tackle the problem space of FDRMs more broadly
- Develop additional interventions to advocate for responsible use of FDRMs
- Define risks in the space and make them more transparent so that ordinary people could be aware of the issues and make better decisions
